For those planning to vote HARDER for Dems in the midterms: please consider what they gave us for 2 years:
* NO minimum wage hikes
* NO fight for healthcare
* NO help for climate change
* MORE ramping up of war
* MORE tax cuts 4 the rich
THIS IS ALL THEY HAVE.

Wait wait wait...

Climate change isn't real
 It is real, but it isn't anything to worry about
 It is pretty bad but it is too expensive to act on
 It is very bad but now it is too late
 We are all going to die, but that is ok
